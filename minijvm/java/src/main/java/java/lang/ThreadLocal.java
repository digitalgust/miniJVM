/**
 * This class provides thread-local variables.  These variables differ from
 * their normal counterparts in that each thread that accesses one (via its
 * <tt>get</tt> or <tt>set</tt> method) has its own, independently initialized
 * copy of the variable.  <tt>ThreadLocal</tt> instances are typically private
 * static fields in classes that wish to associate state with a thread (e.g.,
 * a user ID or Transaction ID).
 *
 * <p>For example, in the class below, the private static <tt>ThreadLocal</tt>
 * instance (<tt>serialNum</tt>) maintains a "serial number" for each thread
 * that invokes the class's static <tt>SerialNum.get()</tt> method, which
 * returns the current thread's serial number.  (A thread's serial number is
 * assigned the first time it invokes <tt>SerialNum.get()</tt>, and remains
 * unchanged on subsequent calls.)
 * <pre>
 * public class SerialNum {
 *     // The next serial number to be assigned
 *     private static int nextSerialNum = 0;
 *
 *     private static ThreadLocal serialNum = new ThreadLocal() {
 *         protected synchronized Object initialValue() {
 *             return new Integer(nextSerialNum++);
 *         }
 *     };
 *
 *     public static int get() {
 *         return ((Integer) (serialNum.get())).intValue();
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Each thread holds an implicit reference to its copy of a thread-local
 * variable as long as the thread is alive and the <tt>ThreadLocal</tt>
 * instance is accessible; after a thread goes away, all of its copies of
 * thread-local instances are subject to garbage collection (unless other
 * references to these copies exist).
