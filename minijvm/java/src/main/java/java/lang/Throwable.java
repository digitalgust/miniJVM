/**
 * The <code>Throwable</code> class is the superclass of all errors and
 * exceptions in the Java language. Only objects that are instances of this
 * class (or of one of its subclasses) are thrown by the Java Virtual Machine or
 * can be thrown by the Java <code>throw</code> statement. Similarly, only this
 * class or one of its subclasses can be the argument type in a
 * <code>catch</code> clause.
 * <p>
 * Instances of two subclasses, {@link java.lang.Error} and
 * {@link java.lang.Exception}, are conventionally used to indicate that
 * exceptional situations have occurred. Typically, these instances are freshly
 * created in the context of the exceptional situation so as to include relevant
 * information (such as stack trace data).
 * <p>
 * By convention, class <code>Throwable</code> and its subclasses have two
 * constructors, one that takes no arguments and one that takes a
 * <code>String</code> argument that can be used to produce an error message.
 * <p>
 * A <code>Throwable</code> class contains a snapshot of the execution stack of
 * its thread at the time it was created. It can also contain a message string
 * that gives more information about the error.
 * <p>
 * Here is one example of catching an exception:
 * <p>
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     try {
 *         int a[] = new int[2];
 *         int b = a[4];
 *     } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
 *         System.out.println("exception: " + e.getMessage());
 *         e.printStackTrace();
 *     }
 * </pre></blockquote>

     * thread-safe and typically called (automatically and implicitly)
     * by the {@code try}-with-resources statement.
     *
     * <p>The suppression behavior is enabled <em>unless</em> disabled
     * {@linkplain #Throwable(String, Throwable, boolean, boolean) via
     * a constructor}.  When suppression is disabled, this method does
     * nothing other than to validate its argument.
     *
     * <p>Note that when one exception {@linkplain
     * #initCause(Throwable) causes} another exception, the first
     * exception is usually caught and then the second exception is
     * thrown in response.  In other words, there is a causal
     * connection between the two exceptions.
     * <p>
     * In contrast, there are situations where two independent
     * exceptions can be thrown in sibling code blocks, in particular
     * in the {@code try} block of a {@code try}-with-resources
     * statement and the compiler-generated {@code finally} block
     * which closes the resource.
     * <p>
     * In these situations, only one of the thrown exceptions can be
     * propagated.  In the {@code try}-with-resources statement, when
     * there are two such exceptions, the exception originating from
     * the {@code try} block is propagated and the exception from the
     * {@code finally} block is added to the list of exceptions
     * suppressed by the exception from the {@code try} block.  As an
     * exception unwinds the stack, it can accumulate multiple
     * suppressed exceptions.
     *
     * <p>An exception may have suppressed exceptions while also being
     * caused by another exception.  Whether or not an exception has a
     * cause is semantically known at the time of its creation, unlike
     * whether or not an exception will suppress other exceptions
     * which is typically only determined after an exception is
     * thrown.
     *
     * <p>Note that programmer written code is also able to take
     * advantage of calling this method in situations where there are
     * multiple sibling exceptions and only one can be propagated.
